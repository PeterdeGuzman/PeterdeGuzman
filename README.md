### 🛠️ I’m looking to collaborate on:

### :notebook: My previous experiences:
- I spent five years as a Researcher and Data Analyst at the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life. At CIRCLE, I evaluated non-partisan voter registration campaigns using R and Tableau to inform non-profit investment. I also designed national surveys to investigate youth political attitudes and political participation among American youth.
- Prior to getting involved in research, I led a non-partisan voter education initiative to engage college students at Tufts University. I have also led outdoor leadership and backpacking programs for youth in New England.
