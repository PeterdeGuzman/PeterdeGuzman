## Hi there 👋

### 📫 Please reach out to me at peter.deguzman@duke.edu!

I am a current Master's in Data Science graduate student at Duke University seeking an internship for Summer 2025.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:  
- A book project with the Department of Political Science analyzing social media data on emerging trends in youth political participation and political polarization 
- A project analyzing the impacts of local institutions and the built environment on political participation by manipulating geospatial data with SQL, Python, and Rust
- I'm currently taking courses on Data Engineering Systems, Data Analytics with Python, Statistical Modeling and Data Visualization, and Alternative Data. 
### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, manipulating GIS data with GeoPandas)
- SQL (and integration with Databricks and AWS)
- Rust
- Data Engineering and DevOps (Creating ETL workflows, implementing CI/CD pipelines, utilizing GitHub Actions)
- Statistical Modeling in R (tidyverse, multiple linear regression, t-tests, and A/B testing)

### :notebook: My previous experiences:
- I spent five years as a Researcher and Data Analyst at the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life. At CIRCLE, I evaluated non-partisan voter registration campaigns using R and Tableau to inform non-profit investment. I also designed national surveys to investigate youth political attitudes and political participation among American youth.
- Prior to getting involved in research, I led a non-partisan voter education initiative to engage college students at Tufts University. I have also led outdoor leadership and backpacking programs for youth in New England.  

### ⚡ Fun facts:
  - My undergraduate majors were Mandarin Chinese Language & Literature and International Relations! I've spent time working and studying in Hangzhou, Beijing, and Xi'an. I love to connect with others over travel, food, the outdoors.
  - I am a huge rugby union fan and still play locally in my area. I also support the Baltimore Ravens and Baltimore Orioles!
